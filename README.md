# TheTowerFarmer
A small C# program to automate various functions in [The Tower - Idle Tower Defense](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TechTreeGames.TheTower).

## Things it does:
 - Keeps the game in battle
 - Claim ad gems (assuming you have disable ads)
 - Claim moving gems

## Emulators
 - Any emulator that supports ADB will work for this bot. Most emulators will install it alongside the emulator.

## Considerations
 - Claiming moving gems has only been tested with the default background. Others may disrupt this function.
 -  Make sure adb.exe is in the path for your PC or in the same directory as TheTowerFarmer.exe.
 -  The game must be on 1600 x 900 resolution.
